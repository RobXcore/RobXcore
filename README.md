Hi there, my name is Roberto and I am a Programmer Analyst.


The road has been long and rocky but I am finally getting somewhere in coding.
I specialize in Javascript and SQL though I am also learning React.
Once I am comfortable enough working with the front-end, I will move to the back-end and combine the two to become the ultimate programmer!
I possess good understanding in object-oriented programming, relational databases and design patterns such as MVC.


That is it, short and sweet description of what I know and want to learn :D.
